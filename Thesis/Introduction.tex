\section{Introduction}

Extensible programming languages were first discussed in the 1960s. As
originally discussed in Douglas McIlroy's 1960 paper, the original concept was
to use a small number of macros in order to extend a compiler to accept very
general extensions to the original language accepted by the compiler 
\cite{5}. This has been modernized in various ways, including the idea
of extensible syntax and compilers.

One example of an extensible programming language is \verb|ABLE|C \cite{7}, 
an extensible version of the C programming language, built on top of the 
\verb|Silver| \cite{2} attribute grammar system. Various extensions exist for 
\verb|ABLE|C that were created to solve various problems. 

This paper examines the uses of extensible programming languages in a real-world
application: an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server implementation. The IRC
protocol was originally designed for text-based conferencing \cite{6}, and
many server implementations are available. For this paper, we consider the
specific implementation of \verb|ngIRCd| (next-generation IRC daemon), written 
in the C programming language. There are several potential issues with this 
server implementation. First, any C program must include runtime checks to 
ensure that all pointers are not null. We introduce an \verb|ABLE|C extension to 
allow for compile-time checking of possible null pointer dereferences.  Another 
issue with the server is writing easily understandable I/O code in C. While the 
\verb|epoll| API provided by the Linux kernel allows for some asynchronous I/O, 
we introduce another \verb|ABLE|C extension to provide improved syntax for 
asynchronous I/O, akin to what Javascript provides. Finally, we introduce an 
extension to ensure that parsing code is secure. We do this utilizing the Wuffs 
programming language \cite{4}, which allows for compile-time checking for various 
parsing attacks which must be manually accounted for at run-time in C.
