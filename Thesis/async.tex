\section{Asynchronous I/O}

\subsection{Asynchronous I/O}
Asynchronous I/O is a major part of the difficulty in creating a server
implemenation in C, particularly when using threads is not a viable option, 
like in a situation where we have limited resources. We
don't want the server to be stuck while we wait for it to perform some I/O
operation like reading or writing to an existing connection when the server has
other tasks it could be doing, like establishing new client connections or
parsing an already-received message. In C, one of the primary ways of performing
asynchronous I/O is using the \verb|epoll| API \cite{5}. Using this API, we are able to
keep a list of file descriptors we want the current process to monitor, as well
as a list of file descriptors that are ready for I/O. However, this process is
extraordinarily tedious, requiring many expensive system calls to set up and
maintain the \verb|epoll| instance. When compared with other, more modern
languages, the \verb|epoll| API is both more verbose and more difficult to use.
Consider a more modern language like Go or Javascript. Both of these languages
have their own facilities for asynchronous operation. In Go, we use several
constructs, including the \verb|go| (to start \emph{goroutines}, which are run by the runtime engine
either on the current thread or automatically on another thread) and \verb|select| (to wait for any operations
from a set of operations to complete) keywords, to implement
various aspects of I/O. In Javascript, we utilize both the \verb|async| and
\verb|await| keywords, as well as the idea of \emph{promises} in order to
achieve some measure of asynchronous operation. The goal of our extension is to
include these same facilities in \verb|ABLE|C, allowing for a programmer to more
easily write and understand the code performing asynchronous I/O operations.

\subsection{Asynchronous I/O Concepts}
%Discussion of extension, mechanics behind it
In this section, we discuss the mechanics of the Asynchronous I/O extension, including
the specifics of the translation from \verb|ABLE|C code to plain C code.

This extension is focused on providing syntax that is both easy to understand and easy to write 
for a programmer utilizing the extension. To this end, we retain the same principles utilized by the 
\verb|epoll| API, but introduce similar syntax to more modern languages with the \verb|spawn| keyword, 
to create asynchronous processes, and the \verb|await| keyword, to wait for those processes to finish.

The \verb|spawn| keyword has similar syntax to the \verb|spawn| keyword in Cilk \cite{2}, the \verb|spawn()| method in
Ruby, or the \verb|spawn()| method in Rust. These keywords and methods all have a similar idea that underlies them. Each of
these languages uses \verb|spawn| to indicate starting a new process, thread or function call. The syntax for all three is
similar, as well. Each has the form \verb|spawn <foo>|, where what is in \verb|foo| is either a function or
a closure (in Rust). This starts program execution on whatever function or closure is passed through \verb|foo|.

The \verb|await| keyword is at least partially inspired by the syntax of Javascript. After we spawn several tasks using
\verb|spawn|, we can then specify that we would like to wait for some of those tasks using \verb|await|. The syntax is similar to
Javascript: we simply write \verb|await <foo>|, where \verb|foo|, after the \verb|await| call, is some timevalue object indicating how 
long to wait. In other words, \verb|await| simply waits until at least one of the tasks we have spawned
finishes, then returns.

\subsection{Asynchronous I/O Extension}
%Discussion of actual implementation of extension
Here we consider what the changes actually are when writing asynchronous code with the extension we have created. 
Consider the code snippets from the \verb|io.c| file, shown below in Figure 5 and the code from the extension in Figure 
6. The major changes between the figures are on lines 23, 45, and 50.

Note in the first example that we utilize the default \verb|io_event_add()| and \verb|io_dispatch()| functions. A particular
issue that arises when dealing with these functions is the lack of immediate, high-level clarity in their calls. Perhaps 
\verb|io_event_add()| is somewhat clear, but the arguments to the \verb|io_dispatch()| function are particularly difficult
to understand. We make a call to the function with some \verb|timeval|, but it is not immediately apparent what the time value
signifies: we don't know if we are waiting for a specific event, for one of many events, or several events.  

On the other hand, consider the implementation using the asynchronous extension. We are using the
\verb|spawn| keyword to create new tasks, in this case, calling out to a \verb|read_helper()| or \verb|write_helper()| function. These
functions are helper functions that simply perform a write or a read to some socket file descriptor, and we are passing them to 
\verb|spawn| as the function to be run asynchronously. Note that because of these helper functions, we simply require the programmer to pass in whatever function the programmer desires to run asynchronously.

This extension is also a much more flexible implementation than what is available with the \verb|epoll| API. As an example,
consider if a programmer wanted to modify the server to do something other than just read or write data. In the old C code, this would
require defining a set of new constants and substantial code modification. In our new extension, all the programmer must be concerned
with is writing whatever function they desire to be executed asynchronously. Then, utilize \verb|spawn| with that function to register that
function for asynchronous execution. There is no need to define any new constants like \verb|IO_WANTREAD| or \verb|IO_WANTWRITE|, 
nor is there a need for the end programmer to do any substantial coding (outside of the function they desire to run asynchronously, which
would have been written anyways without the extension).
